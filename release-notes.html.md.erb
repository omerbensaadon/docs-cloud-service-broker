This release has the following fixes:

* **Azure Storage can now be configured in the tile:**
Previously, there was an issue where Azure Storage configuration was not shown in the tile.

### Known Issues
This release has the following issues:

* **Data loss when updating services:**
Any parameters provided in the `cf create-service` command must also be provided
in the `cf update-service` command.
Otherwise, the broker substitutes default values for those parameters.<br>
For example, if you provided the parameter `db_name` when the service was created,
omitting this parameter from the update service command would result in data loss.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

**The overview describes the service that your product offers to VMware Tanzu developers.
Make sure to overview the features of the integration.
Don't focus only on the overview of your product that is being integrated.
See below for an example.**

This documentation describes the Cloud Service Broker for VMware Tanzu. The Cloud Service Broker for VMware Tanzu enables platform operators to easily expose services to their developers from any public cloud with a Terraform provider. Cloud Service Broker is thoroughly extensible, and can expose new services or public clouds through the use of custom Brokerpaks. CSB Tiles released by the CSB team on TanzuNet support Azure, AWS, and GCP.



**Note**: This overview appears under **OVERVIEW**, combined with the description above in the tile's listing on
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

**Note**: This feature list appears under **FEATURES** in the tile's listing on
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).
Make sure you list the key features of the tile (the integration).
We cannot accept a list of the key features of your product that we are integrating.

Cloud Service Broker includes the following key features:

- **Easily extensible and maintainable** Cloud Service Broker uses [Brokerpak](https://github.com/pivotal/cloud-service-broker/blob/master/docs/brokerpak-intro.md) to expose services. As long as your target public cloud has a [Terraform provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html), services can be provisioned via a common interface using standard cf CLI commands.
- **One common broker for all brokered services.** Cloud Service Broker decouples the service broker functionality from the catalog of services that it exposes.
- **Credhub integration out-of-the-box** CredHub encrypts and manages all the secrets associated with your usage of cloud services.
- **Community** When you expose a service via a [Brokerpak](https://github.com/pivotal/cloud-service-broker/blob/master/docs/brokerpak-intro.md), you can make it available to everyone who uses CSB and vice versa.
- **Easy to migrate** Migrate existing services using [TF Import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html)
